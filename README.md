# feedback-admin

The admin-side module for a feedback web application, which can be utilised at a college/university for collecting and managing feedbacks over a network, submitted by students for their respective teachers.

This application:

1. is made with Go (Google's Golang) as the primary server-side logic handling language.

2. uses 'github.com/codebuff95/uafm' as a user and form management library, and the uafm configuration files can be found in the directory '/feedbackadminres/uafmconfig.json'.

3. harnesses MongoDB's powers to help realise all the data-keeping tasks. This was made possible using the MongoDB driver for Go language, mgo (pronounced as mango).

4. has been designed keeping data security in mind. Maximum loopholes have been tried to be addressed.
