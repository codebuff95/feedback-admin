-> All files inside this directory are being made statically available to the client. Use this directory to create a secure outlet for '.css' (and other) resource files.

-> Access these files in the code using '/resources/' prefix.
Eg- in section.html, use '/resources/style.css' to actually access file 'feedbackadminres/publicres/style.css'.

**NOTE:** Directories bootstrap-3.3.7, font-awesome-4.6.3 and jquery (along with their respective precompiled files) have been .gitignored (check .gitignore for more details). Please add these files to the directory in order for the application to work correctly.

**NOTE:** DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE THIS README FILE BEFORE DEPLOYING THE WEB APP.
